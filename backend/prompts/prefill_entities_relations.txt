You are reviewing a clinical note in TEXT.
Identify medical entities and any explicit relations mentioned.

Entity types: Disease, Medication, Symptom, Procedure.
Relation types: treats, has_symptom, causes, worsens, indicates.

Return a single JSON object:
{
  "entities": [
    {"text": "copied span", "start": int, "end": int, "type": "Disease|Medication|Symptom|Procedure"}
  ],
  "relations": [
    {"source": int, "target": int, "type": "treats|has_symptom|causes|worsens|indicates"}
  ]
}

Guidelines
- Offsets use zero-based [start, end) positions inside TEXT.
- Copy the original casing from TEXT into "text".
- If unsure about an entity or relation, leave it out.
- "source" and "target" reference indices in the entities array.
- Stay concise: respond with JSON only.
